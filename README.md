# YouTube Downloader

The YouTube Downloader application enables users to download videos or audio from YouTube. It has such features as Downloading Video/Audio from a single manually inputed link or download multiple video from a .txt file with several video links.

Execution file for application was made with help of PyInstaller, unfortunately, due to the specifics of the library (which are mentioned on the [official GitHub](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/603) of PyInstaller) Windows Defender detects application as Trojan. That is why I decided not to upload execution file here. If you want to try my YouTube Downloader you will need to write into command line "pip install pytube" and "pip install tk" and run main.py.
